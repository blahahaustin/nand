            Nand Mahasuwan has been training in the performing arts since the early age of 6. He auditioned for every school “Chorus/Play” throughout grade school. Despite any criticism and rejection, Nand never gave up, and finally his tenacity rang true when he landed his first Lead role in “Grease the Musical” during his senior year of high school.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was only during college did he realize his true love and passion for acting. Through college Nand studied in Psychology and Dramatic Arts so he could further develop his skills and understanding of “stepping into a character”. Along the way, he auditioned for everything he could find and landed several lead roles in student films and various other projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Post-Graduation (2016) Nand has relocated to Los Angeles and is continuing his training in various acting studios like Margie Haber, IO West and Killian’s. He spends the majority of his time developing his skills as well as picking up new skills he could learn on the fly; Example: Nand taught himself to fire breathe in 3 days for a job. Some skills Nand has acquired over the years include being bilingual in Thai, longboarding for 7 years, Martial Arts; primarily disciplined in Muay-Thai and Krav-Maga.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nand Mahasuwan is a University of California, Davis Alumni, with a degree in Psychology and is currently SAG-Eligible. He hopes in the not too distant future he could return to school and continue his education and obtain a Master’s in either Psychology or Performing Arts.
